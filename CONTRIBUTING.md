Any kind of contribution is welcome. If you are not sure whether your idea is in line with 
the general direction of the project, feel free to submit new Issue first and let's get the discussion started there.

Please follow pre-existing coding style.

Asking questions via creating new Issue is fine also.

When submitting a new Issue for what seems is a bug, please note the versions (OpenGrok, Tomcat, Universal ctags etc.) you're running and ideally steps to reproduce.

Make sure to add a comment line line to the changeset saying which Issue it is is fixing, e.g. `fixes #XYZ` so that the issue can be automatically closed when the associated pull request is merged.

Each pull request should be accompanied by a comment explaining how the change was tested, unless unit tests are provided/updated.
Please make every effort to make most of your changes covered by tests.

Feel free to add a Copyright line to the source files wehre you made non-trivial changes.

For a pull request to be merged, we need the contributor to sign Oracle Contributor Agreement first.
