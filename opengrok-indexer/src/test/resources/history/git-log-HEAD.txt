    powerpc/mpc85xx: Synchronize timebase the platform correct way

    Summary:
    To safely synchronize timebase we need to disable the timebase on all
    cores, set timebase, and resynchronize.  This adds two new devices, mutually
    exclusive, which attach on the SoC simplebus, to freeze and unfreeze the
    timebase.  The devices are singletons, and platform-specific, so no reason
    to make them optional and in separate files.

    This was found to be necessary for top(1) to work correctly on an AmigaOne
    X5000 (P5020 SoC).  It also fixes bufdaemon and bufspacedaemon hangs at
    shutdown.

    Test Plan: Regression test on various Book-E hardware.

    Add a module dependency on fdt_slicer.  Also, move the PNP_INFO to its more
    usual location, down near the DRIVER_MODULE() stuff.
